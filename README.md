# Astra-Supertars-Training
Just a simple Astra Superstars Training Mode

Thanks to Peon2, their whole work in other training was used here for the core structure and more.

In order to use the training you will need the BizHawk emulator that supports Lua
Once the game is open you will go to
1.Tools
2.Lua Console
3.in the newly open window you will go to Scripts
4.Open script
5.Search for the Astra_training.lua file
6.open it
and you're done, now the game has basic functionality, such as infinite time, max health and inifnite meter
